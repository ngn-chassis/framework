MISC
- image replacement mixin
- maybe some flexbox mixins if they can be done elegantly
- maybe some helper mixins for responsive embeds
- screenreader helpers
- add disabled states to all form controls
- Animated loaders
- Maybe add ui-gutter-x and ui-gutter-y values

BUGS
- Tags need help at scale ratios other than default
- Errors are thrown if you set default vwrs to a wider range than your min/max
  layout width.

COMPONENTS
- Nesting doesn't work beyond one level. Maybe add unnesting operation in spec
  sheets, or simply disallow nesting inside spec sheeets. 

COMPONENT EXTENSION
- consider ways of combining rulesets to shrink the size of the css
- maybe allow extension of component states as well as full components:
@chassis extend button.pill {
	...
}

AUTO-TYPOGRAPHY SYSTEM
- Tags do not look right at small type scale ratios. The math used to
  calculate the position of icons in the tags outputs a negative number at
  small ratios like 1.2. The math for padding seems to break down on inline
  elements at those small ratios as well. In addition, the vertical alignment
  starts behaving very strangely at those small sizes.
- Possible solution is to make sure the scale ratio value is utilized in all
  calculations- right now, some values are just using Math.sin or log or
  something without respect to the actual scale ratio value.
  
FORM COMPONENTS
- Add height rule to inputs, matching line-height, for IE11

NOTE TO SELF: Use viewport units for HORIZONTAL padding on the outside of a UI,
like for gutters, but use percentages on interior elements. This way, the
padding remains in proportion to the container if the font size or container
dimensions are changed, rather than in proportion to the viewport itself, which
doesn't make sense.
