NOTE TO SELF: Use viewport units for HORIZONTAL padding on the outside of a UI,
like for gutters, but use percentages on interior elements. This way, the
padding remains in proportion to the container if the font size or container
dimensions are changed, rather than in proportion to the viewport itself, which
doesn't make sense.

* @import
* Add support for css before @chassis init; call. As of now, this css is either
stripped or inserted after the init mixin css, which prevents @import calls
from working correctly.

PILL
* Remove default pill classes and make a mixin that generates the correct
border-radius for pills.

OR
* Create a custom property for the pill border-radius. This will get around the
extra code needed for more complex components like select menus.

  ISSUE:
  Pills don't look right at small type scale ratios.

THEME
Components need to be able to accept nested selectors. For example, to style an input within a author-control:

author-control {
  @state initial {
    & input {
      background: red;
    }
  }
}

..." input" needs to get appended to the selector list for the initial state.
As of now, it only gets appended to the very end, and so only applies to the final
element in the list.


TEXT MODIFIERS
* truncate should be:
.text-truncate {
  overflow: hidden;
}

* add:
.text-ellipsis {
  overflow: hidden;
  text-overflow: ellipsis;
}

CONSTRAINTS
* Optimization:
If layout.gutter is set to a value not affected by the viewport size (ie vw),
it is unnecessary to output the media queries which constrain the gutter below
and above layout.minWidth and layout.maxWidth respectively.

For example, if I set layout.gutter: '1em', the media queries for .width.constraint
will simply duplicate the padding-left and padding-right decls. Hence, the
media queries can be removed altogether.
